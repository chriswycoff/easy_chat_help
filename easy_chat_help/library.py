    "What has been your most challenging project as a software architect, and how did you navigate through that challenge?": "My most challenging software project was Realtor.com/ai this project had many stakeholders pleasing everyone was a challenge. Additionally it involved hosting a large machine learning model to the cloud that could be queried in a scalable way. I needed to scale to thousands of concurrent users. The architecture of the program was challenging as well as it needed to generate images from text and do a vector store search with many filters and subtleties.",
    "Could you share an example of a critical mistake or setback you've experienced in your career and how you turned that situation into a learning opportunity?": "When I was 16 I got a job at a sports bar doing magic tricks. I really enjoyed interacting with people and it was an amazing opportunity. However when the manager of the bar got fired and a new manager took over there was a miscommunication and they did not schedule me to come in. Instead of taking charge and communicating to the owner what happened I let the opportunity lapse and I did not got back in. I regretted not advocating and communicating in this situation. This experience helped me learn about communicating clearly and timely when something is going wrong.",
    "Can you tell us about a recent technological advancement that's caught your attention, and why do you think it has the potential to change the world?": "I think that blockchain technology is extremely likely to change the world. Most people see blockchain as a financial technology, but I see it as a human organization technology. I think that humans will be able to use blockchain tech to organize themselves in more efficient and effective ways. I think that many of the roles of a centralized government has can be replaced with blockchain. I believe this is an opportunity because it will lead to a less corrupt-able system of governance allowing for direct democracy, more transparency in terms of resource allocation  and more accountability for public servants."
